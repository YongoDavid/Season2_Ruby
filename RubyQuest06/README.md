Welcome to Ruby Quest06
In this quest we have three excersises. Ex 00: Making use of CSV (Column seperated values) Your goal is to transform a string following the CSV format to a 2d array. Your function will take two arguments, the contents of a CSV as a string and a separator. Your function will return an array (line) of arrays (columns). Ex 01: We have been provided with a dataset of sales from My Online Coffee Shop. It's a CSV (Comma Separated Values) (each column is separated by , and each line is separated by ). Our goal will be to identify customers who are more likely to buy coffee online. Ex 02: We have been provided with a dataset of sales from My Online Coffee Shop. It's a CSV (Comma Separated Values) (each column is separated by , and each line is separated by ). Our goal will be to identify customers who are more likely to buy coffee online. This time we will need to create a function with code logic, not just return the solution hard coded. :D Data management is a hard problem. To better solve this hard problem, we will split them into smaller ones.

Task
The task at hand involves processing CSV data in Ruby. This includes parsing CSV strings into 2D arrays, transforming specific columns based on predefined rules, and processing the transformed data to generate meaningful insights. This task presents several challenges:

Efficiently parsing CSV data with varying separators.
Applying transformation rules to specific columns while preserving data integrity.
Generating actionable insights from processed data.
Description
To tackle the task, we've developed a set of functions in Ruby that handle various aspects of CSV data manipulation. This includes functions for parsing CSV strings into arrays, transforming specific columns according to given criteria, and processing the transformed data to generate actionable insights. Our approach involves:

Utilizing Ruby's built-in CSV parsing capabilities for efficient data extraction.
Implementing custom transformation logic to handle column-specific requirements.
Employing data processing techniques to extract valuable insights for decision-making.
