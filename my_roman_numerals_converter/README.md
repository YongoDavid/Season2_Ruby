The challenge lies in implementing the conversion algorithm.
This conversion algorithm that accurately maps each number to its corresponding Roman numeral representation, adhering to the rules of Roman numeral notation.

## Description
The problem is solved by implementing a Ruby function named to_roman.
This function utilizes a mapping of numeric values to their respective Roman numeral symbols.
It iterates through the mapping in descending order, appending the appropriate Roman numeral symbols to a result string while decrementing the input number accordingly.
The solution ensures that the Roman numerals are generated correctly for the given input numbers.
