# Welcome to Ruby Quest02
Welcome too another quest oon Ruby , i will be doing more with the the ruby programming language.
In this Quest i will be working on if statements that will print and output when certain conditions are met,
Also we will be seeing hoow function work and are defined in Ruby.
i will also be looking at while statements on ruby.
Also be working with Functions accept parameters. 
and Functions that also return value(s) and the return value(s) can be used later on
More of the things on the project will still just be getting to know the syntax for wrting code with ruby
## Task
There are 5 tasks in this quest and task one is to write the correct conditions inside the if statements in order to render the 2 print statements true!.
Task two is to organize code by writing structured functions.
Task three is to implement a while loop to print 100 times "I want to code".
Task four is to write Functions that accept parameters. By sending an integer to our function and print it! ,Implement a while loop to call a function 
Task five is to write Functions that can also return values
## Description
In this quest, we aim to deepen our understanding of the Ruby programming language by exploring conditional statements, loops, and functions. 
Hereâ€™s how we solved the problems:
Conditional Statements: We wrote if statements with conditions that evaluate to true, triggering the corresponding print statements.
Structured Functions: We organized our code by defining functions, making the code more modular and readable.
While Loops:We implemented a while loop to repeatedly print a message, demonstrating control flow in Ruby.
Functions with Parameters:We created functions that accept parameters, showcasing how to pass data to functions and use it within.
Functions Returning Values: We wrote functions that return values, allowing us to use the returned data elsewhere in our code.

By completing these tasks, we have learned essential Ruby syntax and constructs, preparing us for more advanced programming challenges.

## Installation
To get started with Ruby Quest02, ensure that Ruby is installed on your system.
Fork this project from my github repo.
or you can download as a zipfile straight to your local machine and then run all the code from your IDE

## Usage
After installing Ruby and cloning the repository, you can start working with the Ruby scripts provided in this quest.
By following these steps, you will gain hands-on experience with conditional statements, loops, and functions in Ruby.
This will enhance your programming skills and understanding of the language.
