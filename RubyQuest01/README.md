# Welcome to Ruby Quest01
This is Rby quest we will be working with is just an introdction to ruby.
We will start of by knowing the basics whihc is just the syntax of ruby.
Every languahe has its own way of carry out logic and here we will see a little of that.
## Task
First of we will start with learning how to print content of a ruby file to the console / terminal.
We will also look at different way to declare variables and diffrent variable types.
Vriable tyles like String , integers , and characters.


## Description
In this quest, we aim to familiarize ourselves with the Ruby programming language.
The initial problem is to understand and implement basic Ruby syntax.
This involves writing simple scripts to output text to the console, declaring variables of various types, and manipulating these variables. 
The project is structured to build a strong foundational understanding of Ruby, making it easier to grasp more complex concepts in subsequent quests.
To solve the problem, we will:
1. Write Ruby scripts to print messages to the console.
2. Declare and initialize variables of different types (String, Integer, Character).
3. Understand and implement basic Ruby syntax and conventions.
4. Run and debug Ruby scripts to ensure they perform as expected.

## Installation
To get started with Ruby Quest01, you need to have Ruby installed on your system. 
After installing Ruby you can get fork this project from my github repo.
or you can download the zip file straight you 

## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
