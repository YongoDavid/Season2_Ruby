# Welcome to Ruby Quest03
In this Quest we will be delving more into ruby and knowing more on how certain operations are carried out.
we will learn how to print any argument received to the script.
we will be working on a function that should return a 1 or 0 depending on the integerâ€™s sign entered as a parameter.
Also in this Quest we will Reproduce the behavior of an abs() function. It always returns the positive value of a number.\
We will also be writing functions that take 2 parameters and returns a value by adding , subtracting and multiplying.
Lastly we will look at formatting with Ruby.

## Task
The challenge involves mastering various Ruby operations and how they work, 
Opereation like handling dfferent arguments.
Operations like implementing mathematical functions that return an out put, example addition , subtraction , and multiplication , and formatting strings.

## Description
This project consists of several tasks:
Printing Arguments:Create a script that prints any argument received.
Sign Determination Function:Implement a function `my_is_negative` that returns 1 for positive or zero inputs and 0 for negative inputs.
Absolute Value Function: Implement a function `my_abs` to replicate the behavior of the `abs()` function, returning the positive value of a number.
Addition Function: Create a function `my_add` that adds two parameters and returns the result.
Subtraction Function: Implement a function `my_sub` that subtracts one parameter from another and returns the result.
Multiplication Function: Create a function `my_mult` that multiplies two parameters and returns the result.
String Formatting Function: Develop a function `my_string_formatting` that formats and prints a string with provided first name, last name, and age.
