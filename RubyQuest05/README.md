Welcome to Ruby Quest05
In this quest, we delve into various array manipulation techniques using Ruby. Each function we implement will perform a specific operation on arrays, enhancing your understanding of array handling in Ruby.

Task
In this project, we aim to master different array operations through the implementation of several functions. These functions include iterating over arrays, performing operations on array elements, and manipulating array contents. The challenges are as follows: my_each: Print each element of an array of strings. my_map_mult_two: Multiply each element of an integer array by 2. my_count_on_it: Count the length of each element in a string array. my_array_uniq: Remove duplicates from an integer array. my_is_sort: Check if an integer array is sorted in ascending or descending order. The primary challenge is to implement these functions efficiently and correctly, utilizing Ruby's array methods and control structures.

Description
To address these tasks, we leverage Ruby's powerful array handling features. Here's a detailed breakdown of each function: my_each : This function receives an array of strings and iterates through each element, printing its value. It returns nothing.

my_map_mult_two : This function receives an integer array and iterates over each element, multiplying it by 2. It collects and returns the new array with the multiplied values.

my_count_on_it : This function receives an array of strings and returns a new array containing the length of each string.

my_array_uniq : This function receives an integer array and returns a new array with all duplicate values removed.

my_is_sort This function receives an integer array and returns a boolean indicating whether the array is sorted in ascending or descending order. It handles arrays with duplicates and numbers in the range of -2,000,000 to 2,000,000.

Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine. You can also fork this project from my repository Another way is to download this project as a zip file and run it straight on your local machine

Usage
Once you have cloned the repository and installed Ruby, you can start using the functions. Explore the functions by providing different inputs to see how they handle various cases. This project aims to strengthen your understanding of array operations in Ruby and enhance your problem-solving skills in programming.
