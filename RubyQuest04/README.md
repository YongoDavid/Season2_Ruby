##Welcome to Ruby Quest04
In this quest, we explore the versatility of Ruby by implementing various string manipulation functions. These functions are fundamental building blocks for more complex programming tasks and provide a solid understanding of string operations in Ruby.

##Task
In this project, we will implement several string manipulation functions using Ruby. These functions include locating a character in a string, converting a string to uppercase and lowercase, and determining the length of a string. The challenges are as follows: my_string_index: Locate the first occurrence of a character in a string and return its position. my_upcase: Convert a given string to its uppercase equivalent. my_downcase: Convert a given string to its lowercase equivalent. my_size: Determine the length of a given string. The primary challenge is to implement these functions efficiently and correctly, utilizing Ruby's string methods and control structures. my_downcase : This function takes a string as a parameter and returns its lowercase version. We utilize Ruby's downcase method to achieve this transformation. my_size : This function takes a string as a parameter and returns its length. By leveraging Ruby's length method, we can easily determine the size of the string.

##Description
To address these tasks, we leverage Ruby's powerful string handling features. Here's a detailed breakdown of each function: my_string_index : This function accepts two parameters: haystack (the string to search within) and needle (the character to find). The function loops through the haystack, checking each character to see if it matches the needle. If a match is found, the function returns the position of the needle. If no match is found, it returns -1. my_upcase : This function takes a string as a parameter and returns its uppercase version. Using Ruby's built-in upcase method, we convert each character to its uppercase equivalent.

##Installation
To get started with this project, you can clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine. You can also fork this project from my git repository. And also download this project as a zip file and ruun on your local machine.

##Usage
Explore the functions by providing different inputs to see how they handle various cases. This project aims to solidify your understanding of string manipulation in Ruby and enhance your problem-solving skills in programming.
